### About

A simple message board project as required by [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs/lessons/members-only). The purpose is to practice on basic authentication using Passport middleware local strategy

### How It Works

A message board app. The membership tiers are as follow:

1. Unregistered Guest: able to see the messages on the board but not the author and the timestamp
2. Non Member User: once signed up ond logged in, user is able to create new message.
3. Full Member: on top of creating new message, member is able to see the author and timestamp of each message
4. Admin: added capability to delete message

To register as user just sign up and then log in using the username and password. Membership can later be upgraded using provided passcode
